EC601-HW is about changing the httpstat.py output and learning to use trello and github.

httpstat.py:
The main file is httpstat.py which is programmed in python. We changed the file output and added percents to show more obvious which step takes longer in total time.

The origin output of the program is:

After we changed and added percent to the program, the output is:


Also, we used trello to record the process from the beginning of this homework, including the each changes of the program and conversation about the homework.

We also used burndown for trello to monitor the burndown chart.

STEP 1:
Learn how to use github.

Download git and install it correctly.
Clone the repository from github.


STEP 2:

Pull the file from the master branch.
Input "python httpstat.py cnn.com"(or any other website) in terminal to run the file.
The output of the program will be the response of the connection to the website, including time of every step it takes and the percent.


PS: hehe.txt in the branch is an empty file which is used to learn how to push files in github.
